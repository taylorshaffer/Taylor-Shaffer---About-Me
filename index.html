        <div class="subheading mb-5">About MeðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Hi there! I am a undergrad Psychology student at University of California, Riverside. I transferred from Diablo Valley College where I originally was a business major, but then I quickly found my love for psychology. A little bit about me is that I am somewhat introverted but it may not seem that way. In my free time I enjoy reading non-fiction novels, hanging out with my family and listening to music. I have a smaller immediate family but a very large extended one. Because of this experience growining up, I have learned how to be dynamic when it comes to communicating with various types of people. 
 <br><br>

       I am taking computer science classes because I come from the heart of the tech scene here in Silicon Valley where both of my parents work as VP software engineers. Technology has been a large part of my childhood that was influenced by my dad. He has taught me HTML CSS and Ruby on Rails which I enjoyed, but as a psychology major I did not want to simply take random electives, so I continued down the CS path to further this knowledge. So far I have taken logic, application development and now I am currently enrolled in intro to programming. Out of these classes so far, I loved learning logic. Although it is applicable to programming, I find it use full in everyday life as well. After diving into computer science and its basics, I am looking to build a solid foundation of my knowledge in order to land a job in the ever expanding tech world. <br><br>

        I have had many customer service jobs throughout high school and have worked my way into higher up positions. This has helped me further my experience developing leadership qualities that I look to expand and apply to the next job I take on after graduation. In the summer of 2019 I worked as a field technician for DTS Network Solutions, where I was assembling and running diagnostics for their ballot machinery. This position gave me hands on experience working with the hardware of the machines and testing them for quality assurance. These jobs coupled with my psychology degree have prepared me to not only understand the products that I am working with, but also to make lasting connections with the people I am working with. These qualities have led me to be a team player that is able to ensure a well running work environment for myself and those around me. I am a fast learner, with great communication skills and well evolved problem solving skills. If you are interested in getting to know more about me or inquiring possible future positions please feel free to reach out and we can chat via any of the links I have provided below. With this opportunity being my first job out of college, I am not limited to what roles I take on. I am looking for work in information technology, human resources, business marketing, sales, and more.
