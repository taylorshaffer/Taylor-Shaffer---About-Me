        <p class="lead mb-4">Hi there! I am a undergrad Psychology student at University of California, Riverside. I am a transfer student from Diablo Valley College where I originally was a business major, but then I quickly found my love for psychology. A little bit about me is that I am somewhat introverted but it may not seem that way. In my free time I enjoy reading non-fiction novels, hanging out with my family and listening to music. I have a smaller immediate family but a very large extended one. Because of this experience growing up it has helped me become a more dynamic person when it comes to being able to communicate with various types of people no matter their age. 
 <br><br>

       I am taking computer science classes because I come from the heart of the tech scene here in Silicon Valley where both of my parents work as software engineers and project managers. Technology has been a large part of my childhood that was influenced by my dad. He has taught me some HTML and Ruby on Rails which I enjoyed, but as a psychology major I did not want to just take random electives so I continued down the CS path to further this knowledge. So far I have taken logic, application development and now I am currently enrolled in intro to programming. Out of these classes so far, I loved learning logic. Although it is applicable to programming, I find it use full in everyday life as well. After diving into computer science and its basics, I am looking to build a solid foundation of my knowledge in order to land a job in the ever expanding tech world. <br><br>

        I have had many customer service jobs throughout high school and have worked my way into higher up positions which has helped me further my experience in developing leadership qualities that I want to expand and apply to the next job I take on after graduation. In the summer of 2018 I worked as a field technician for DTS network solutions where I was assembling and running diagnostics for their ballot machinery. This position gave me hands on experience working with hardware of the machines and testing them for quality assurance. These jobs coupled with my psychology degree have prepared me to not only understand the products that I am working with, but also allowed me to understand the people I am working with. These qualities have taught me to be a team player, that helps ensure a well running work environment for those around me. I am a fast learner, with good communication skills and well evolved problem solving skills. If you are interested in getting to know more about me or just want to chat about future positions please feel free to reach out to me and we can chat. With this opportunity being my first job out of college, I am not limited to what roles I take on. I am looking for work in information technology, human resources, business marketing, sales, and more.
